        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, my name is Akshat, Akie, Indra, Navier... Or just the man with a million names, but you will know me best as Shivaya Gojo. I'm a spontaneous, sometimes chaotic, film-lover with a passion for writing and creating ideas in the screenplay format. (P.S: It's not just because I suck at writing a novel).</p>
        <p>I began screenwriting in 2020 amidst the pandemic when my friend introduced to me it and I've been writing ever since. I'm managed to finish a few projects, and am still continuing with others. I mostly write action, adventure stories that are set place in fictional worlds (city or the entire world). I focus on different types of characters, both male and female, and find my strengths in writting strong, independent Main Characters, and terrifying Antagonists.</p>
        <p>I mostly write my own stories and ideas, but I have no problem writing stories for other people whether for free or for commission.</p>
        <p>My goal is to enter the film industry not just as a writer, but also as a director. So, if any producers or directors are reading this, hit me up!</p>
